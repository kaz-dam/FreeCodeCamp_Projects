# FreeCodeCamp_Projects

In this repository i will upload the projects from FreeCodeCamp that i've completed. They can be found on my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kazdam/ "My Codepen page") site too. They're all interesting projects i think, so i like to have them here.

### Random Quote Machine

The first of the intermediate front-end projects. I've used the WikiQuote API to get the random quotes from movies i like much. Thumbs up goes to Nate Tyler for his [wikiquotes-api](https://github.com/natetyler/wikiquotes-api/).
