# FreeCodeCamp_Projects

In this repository i will upload the projects from FreeCodeCamp that i've completed. They can be found on my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kazdam/ "My Codepen page") site too. They're all interesting projects i think, so i like to have them here.

### Random Quote Machine

The first of the intermediate front-end projects. I've used the WikiQuote API to get the random quotes from movies i like much. Thumbs up goes to Nate Tyler for his [wikiquotes-api](https://github.com/natetyler/wikiquotes-api/).

### Local Weather App

The API for the weather data was from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/). Some CSS3 animation has been used representing the current local weather visually.

### Wikipedia viewer

First FCC project where i used only Angular as javascript framework. Using almost the same API as for the random quote project, but this was easier. This time the extra tool wasn't necessary to make requests to this API.

### Twitch.tv stream viewer
