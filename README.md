# FreeCodeCamp_Projects

In this repository i will upload the projects from FreeCodeCamp that i've completed. They can be found on my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kazdam/ "My Codepen page") site too. They're all interesting projects i think, so i like to have them here.

### Random Quote Machine

The first of the intermediate front end projects. I've used the WikiQuote API to get the random quotes from movies i like much. Thumbs up goes to Nate Tyler for his [wikiquotes-api](https://github.com/natetyler/wikiquotes-api/).

### Local Weather App

The API for the weather data was from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/). Some CSS3 animation has been used representing the current local weather visually.

### Wikipedia viewer

First FCC project where i used only Angular as javascript framework. Using almost the same API as for the random quote project, but this was easier. This time the extra tool wasn't necessary to make requests to this API.

### Twitch.tv stream viewer

Made again with Angular because it's fun to work with it. The Twitch.tv API was used to get data from certain users/streamers and show some data about them. Are they currently streaming, what they're streaming etc.

### Javascript Calculator

With this one started the advanced front end projects part. Didn't used any fancy stuff. Design is based on the classic Casio calculators and made only with CSS. Other than that the JS is simple and functional type using jQuery to make DOM manipulation easier. As an extra (this wasn't a task), added event listeners to the buttons that could be used for this "app".

### Pomodoro Clock

I've designed the clock according to the famous clock from the movie Groundhog Day. You know pomodoro clock is also looping around just like the movie.
So the look was made only with CSS. Used some almost matching fonts from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the displayed numbers and for the manufacturer logo (which begins with Pana...haha). For the JS part i've used only jQuery to make DOM searches and some tasks easier.

### Tic Tac Toe Game

The design came from the idea how this should probably played. On a piece of paper with a marker. This was a tricky one though. For the AI was used the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best next move recurring all the possible and upcoming moves on the board.

### Simon Game

The design is not the well known Simon game design. Didn't wanted to create the same layout so i just went with the look of a drumpad. This was one of the projects that look very easy at first and if i get more into the details it became more complicated. I was using only jQuery on the js part.
